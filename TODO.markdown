# So many frameworks!

## For sure

* Lemon (really interesting linking of tests and methods)
* Testy (sample code doubles as a test suite)

## Projects I might want to include

* Bacon (negative: it's basically just rspec, right?)
* Micronaut (negative: it adds some to rspec, but looks mostly like an 
  rspec clone)
* Zebra (one-line tests without extra 'comments'; problem: last updated 
  2009?)
* https://github.com/rubyworks/microtest
* https://github.com/rubyworks/lime
* https://github.com/rubyworks/citron


## Done

* Shindo (clear focus on return value; also apparently has a good 
  interactive mode)
* https://github.com/peterc/testrocket.git
