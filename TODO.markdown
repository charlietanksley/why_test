# To do

* Add better tests (find a way to test the generated code).
* Add more frameworks.
* Consider adding some switches (like --no-sample for no sample code, or 
  --one for Ruby 1.8 (v. 1.9)).
 
# So many frameworks!

## For sure

* Lemon (really interesting linking of tests and methods)
* Testy (sample code doubles as a test suite)

## Projects I might want to include

* Bacon (negative: it's basically just rspec, right?)
* Micronaut (negative: it adds some to rspec, but looks mostly like an 
  rspec clone)
* Zebra (one-line tests without extra 'comments'; problem: last updated 
  2009?; second problem: depends on gems that don't exit or don't work 
  with 1.9.2.)
* https://github.com/rubyworks/microtest
* https://github.com/rubyworks/lime
* https://github.com/rubyworks/citron


## Done

* Shindo (clear focus on return value; also apparently has a good 
  interactive mode)
* https://github.com/peterc/testrocket.git
