# So many frameworks!

## For sure

* Lemon (really interesting linking of tests and methods)
* Zebra (one-line tests without extra 'comments')
* Testy (sample code doubles as a test suite)
* https://github.com/peterc/testrocket.git

## Projects I might want to include

* Bacon (negative: it's basically just rspec, right?)
* Micronaut (negative: it adds some to rspec, but looks mostly like an 
  rspec clone)

## Done
* Shindo (clear focus on return value; also apparently has a good 
  interactive mode)
